				<p>The Gray Creek community hall was built by volunteers in the winter of 1912/13 from hand-hewn fire-killed cedar logs, on land regarded as useless by the fruit ranching settlers. Useless then, priceless now – the land is a legacy for today’s community that values the beach and the view. <p>
				<p>The Hall has changed very little in its lifetime; a kitchen was added in the late 1920’s, the cloakroom, stage and storage room in 1958. The Hall functioned as a one-room school from 1914-1944 - the original chalkboards are still hanging in the Hall. The Gray Creek Hall has been integral to the life of the community since the beginning and is still in regular use today.</p>
